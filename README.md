# baanreserveren

Make court reservations on baanreserveren.nl while you are still in bed!

## How does it work?

- Copy the sample env file to `.env` and change the settings.
- Build the source (`yarn build`) and run the project (`yarn start`) to attempt a reservation.
- Take a look at the source code for the details regarding time slots, debugging etc ;-)
